                     <p>Strong efforts need to be put to tackle issues in the sector, as Kenya is classified as a water-scarce country. This, 
                     coupled with more frequent cycles of severe and unpredictable weather conditions and increased 
                     rates of natural resource depletion, will make water less available, especially in the countryâ€™s arid 
                     and semi-arid areas, calling for urgent and sustainable solutions.</p>
                     <p>Another structural issue facing the sector is that the water service providers in Kenya struggle 
                     to raise the capital and strengthen local capacities needed to accelerate water delivery. 
                     Inequalities in access to water and sanitation were large across areas of residence and counties. 
                     Rainfall patterns as well as existing investments by national and county government, as well as 
                     international partners, are some of the key factors that explain part of these differences.</p>
                     <p>In 2019, the share of the population in rural areas deprived in water was more than twice that in urban 
                     areas, 46 versus 21 percent, respectively. Likewise, while nearly 3 in 10 persons in rural areas 
                     were deprived of adequate sanitation, in urban areas the deprivation rate was 1 in 10 persons.</p>
